# xeonio_linux
The xenio_linux project aims to meet the needs of musicians and artists who align with free software, more specifically the Debian philosophy. The distro fully aligns with the commitment to stability and longevity of Debian Stable, but severely facilitates various resources for artists and musicians who depend on free solutions, in addition to, of course, including the kernel, Mesa, Nvidia drivers (my personal need), as well as pre-configured multimedia and design plugins and software.

At the moment, the system hasn't even left the drawing board, but I'm open to suggestions. My name is João Vitor, I'm 19 years old, I admire the open source world and I've been on this journey since 2021. Many ridiculed me with Vision Linux, a project that didn't even leave the drawing board due to a lack of maturity and knowledge on my part at the time, but today I come with much more experience and intuition. I thank everyone who supported me on this journey, which has definitely not come to an end.
